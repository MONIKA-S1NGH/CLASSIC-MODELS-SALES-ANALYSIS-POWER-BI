# CLASSIC-MODELS-SALES-ANALYSIS-POWER-BI

DESCRIPTION

A Small Company Axon, which is a retailer selling Classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales Team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze data.
To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business intelligence(BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted MY SQL and POWER BI.
